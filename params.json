{"name":"Wmcchat","tagline":"","body":"### WMcChat\r\nHello there, welcome to my website for WMcChat!\r\n\r\n### Why use WMcChat?\r\nWe have Minecraft. We have MineChat. Why make another chat client?\r\nWMcChat aims to be different. Unlike the other clients:\r\n* WMcChat does not store any files on your computer\r\n* WMcChat does not require downloading anything\r\n* WMcChat is not resource intensive (like Minecraft)\r\n* WMcChat can be put on a website - see usage below\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nHow do you use this? Firstly, you need Java 7. Sorry Java 6 fans, I've tried but it requires the Java 7 features to work properly. Then, you need this awesome code here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTML Code which is still yet to be created\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply, put this code anywhere on the web - on the internet, on your website (especially on your website). It's embeddable and that code can put it anywhere which accepts HTML.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what it would look like:\r\n(Put example of it here)\r\n\r\n### FAEAQ (Frequent and easily answered questions)\r\n* Q: It's a scam! They store your password and try to hack your account!\r\n* A: No, seriously guys - this is not a scam. It uses the same code as the regular Minecraft login and is 100% safe. If it makes you feel better, I don't even know how to store that information in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nNeed help?
