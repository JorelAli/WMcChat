{"name":"Wmcchat","tagline":"","body":"### WMcChat\r\nHello there, welcome to my website for WMcChat! WMcChat is a Minecraft chat client, similar to MineChat, except for the web!\r\n\r\n### Why use WMcChat?\r\nWe have Minecraft. We have MineChat. Why make another chat client?\r\nWMcChat aims to be different. Unlike the other clients:\r\n* WMcChat does not store any files on your computer (unlike Minecraft)\r\n* WMcChat does not require downloading anything (unlike Minecraft)\r\n* WMcChat is not resource intensive (unlike Minecraft)\r\n* WMcChat can be put on a website - see usage below\r\n* WMcChat can be used on computers (unlike MineChat)\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nVersion 2.0 is going to be the next release:\r\n* Neater, smaller GUI\r\n* Better connecting to server system\r\n* Temporarily storing join/leave information so it can join other servers quicker\r\n* Support for formatted text (bold, italics etc.)\r\n* Fixed up typos\r\n\r\nVersion 3.0 ideas:\r\n* List of servers which can be defined by the person who embedded WMcChat into the webpage\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n* Java doesn't work on 64bit systems on Mac - honestly, not my fault but it's the only caveat we have here...\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nHow do you use this? Firstly, you need Java 7. Sorry Java 6 fans, I've tried but it requires the Java 7 features to work properly. Then, you need this code here:\r\n<font color=\"#ff0000\">I seriously recommend not doing this because this is WMcChatMini and is kinda outdated</font>\r\n\r\n```\r\n<embed id=\"WMcChat\" type=\"application/x-java-applet;version=1.6\" width=\"298\" height=\"380\" archive=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77591131/MyApplet1.jar, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77591131/MCProtocolLib.jar\" code=\"com.droppages.Skepter.Start\" pluginspage=\"http://java.com/download/\">\r\n<param name=\"permissions\" value=\"all-permissions\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply, put this code anywhere on the web - on the internet, on your website (especially on your website). It's embeddable and that code can put it anywhere which accepts HTML.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what it would look like:\r\n(Put example of it here)\r\n\r\n### FAEAQ (Frequent and easily answered questions)\r\n* Q: It's a scam! They store your password and try to hack your account!\r\n* A: No, seriously guys - this is not a scam. It uses the same code as the regular Minecraft login and is 100% safe. If it makes you feel better, I don't even know how to store that information in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nNeed help? Contact Skepter ... somehow ...\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n* I seriously need to get pages for this website so I can put this on another page\r\n* Version 1.2\r\n* 'Initial Release'\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
